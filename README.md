# WalletMatrix

If you're reading this, then chances are good that you work for a wallet vendor and are looking at the WalletMatrix [Schema](https://walletmatrix.app/schema). This small repo is an example `matrix.json` file based on the [Version 3 Schema](https://walletmatrix.app/schema/v3.json). You can refer to it when maintaining your own matrix.json file.

This example is based on a mobile wallet app with a comprehensive set of Security, Privacy and Lightning features. Not all features make sense together, but given the range of possible feature combinations, WalletMatrix will only validate against valid JSON and valid data with respect to the schema. We assume vendors know most about their wallets features.

Please also refer to the [glossary](https://walletmatrix.app/glossary) where matrix.json features are detailed.
