# WalletMatrix

If you're reading this, then chances are good that you work for a wallet vendor and are looking at the WalletMatrix [Schema](https://walletmatrix.app/schema). This small repo is an example of a [Version 3 Schema](https://walletmatrix.app/schema/v3.json) for you to refer to when maintaining your own matrix.json files.

Please also refer to the [glossary](https://walletmatrix.app/glossary) where all matrix.json features are defined.
